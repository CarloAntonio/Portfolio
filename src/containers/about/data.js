I gravitate towards videography over photography because it limits interpretation, in that, context is created by the very nature of time elapsing. You can either create a narrative or capture one, conversely it is far more difficult to do so in photographs. Often times, pictures require background knowlege of context, creator intention, etc. Videos much less so, a trait I love exploring when I'm creating content`

There's also nothing like hiking miles of trails to arrive at a destination only a those who have persisted the same path have been. Some people think it's contrary to be both passionate about technology and nature, but in my opinion, it's a necessary balance.`

I've known it since I was 9 years old, and even though I'm no Kobe Bryant and this isn't a "Dear Basketball" ripoff, I can and have always had basketball to help clear my head. Big decisions, breakups, fights, anxiety, impatience, grudges and just about anything else seem a little easier to deal with after running up and down the court and having a silent conversation with the hoop.`

I literally just thought of this right now. There's something so satisfying about tearing it up in the brain department, then doing the same in the body department. Putting on wireless headphones and going in on the workouts is the most zen you can get on a work day.`
